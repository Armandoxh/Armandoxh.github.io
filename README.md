# Battleship 2.0 
## Concept: 
An adapted version of Hasbro's popular game "Battleship". Players who played the normal battleship will recognize the basic gameplay mechanics. However, there's a twist when "action-cards" get added to the mix. Players will now have the ability to gather powerups for their moves, giving them more control over the turn-based classic.

## Approach: 
First, a standard battleship game will need to be built. This consists of two 8x8 or 10x10 grids (one for each player) and the players will have the option to place their ships on any row or column on their field. There are 6 ships with varying lengths spanning from 2 to 5.  Players then take turns choosing a square at random on the opponent's grid to choose to shoot a missile at. If the player hits an enemy ship one time on each square it takes up on the grid, the ship is destroyed. Players take turns until one player loses all of their ships. 

The twist: Players will begin their turn with 3 action - cards (see above). These action cards will be usable before the player makes their choice of where to attack. Every time a player scores a "HIT", the player recieves an action fragment at random. Collecting two fragment cards will result in the player receiving a usable action-card of that type.
